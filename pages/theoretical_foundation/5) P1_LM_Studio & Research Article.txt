The Scientific Method

Define a Question: Observations and data spark a question to investigate.

Make Predictions: Form a hypothesis — a testable explanation based on evidence.

Gather Data: Collect evidence through observation, experiment, or models. Ensure procedures can be repeated.

Analyze Data: Organize results into tables, graphs, or diagrams; look for patterns.

Draw Conclusions: Decide if evidence supports the hypothesis. Share results and refine with new questions.

Why We Document the Tech Stack:Science is reproducible
Other researchers must be able to repeat your work with the same tools and methods.

AI is part of your methods
Hardware (CPU, RAM, GPU, storage), software (Ollama, Streamlit, Excel), and models (Mistral, Gemma) all affect results.

Tech stack = lab equipment
Just like scientists list microscopes or chemicals, you must list your computing setup.



Why We Document the Tech Stack:Equity through minimum requirements
Sharing the lowest specs needed lets others try your project on their own devices.

Adherence to a Data Scientific Method
Careful documentation of tools and constraints ensures your project is credible, testable, and reproducible.

Integrity & trust
Transparent methods are your best defense against accusations of misusing AI—clear documentation proves you did the work responsibly.

Hardware Stack: What we have in class: 

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8745H
RAM: 32GB DDR5
Graphics: Radeon 780M integrated GPU
Storage: 1TB SSD


Hardware Stack: 

Minimum Hardware to Reproduce:

CPU: Intel i5 (10th gen or newer) / AMD Ryzen 5 (5000 series or newer)

RAM: 16GB DDR4/DDR5

Storage: SSD (256GB+)

Note: A discrete GPU (e.g., RTX 3060+) improves speed but is not required.

The Activity Objective: 

A student is working on their Senior Capstone Project. They want to do their work on “floating solar panels.” They have identified 3 research objectives that, if accomplished, will make a very successful project. 

The student found an article online. It definitely meets criteria for a credible source (see next slides). 

We will use an AI to help us determine if a research article can help a student achieve their research objectives. 

Credible Academic Source

Author & Institution: Written by an expert or reputable organization with clear credentials.

Publication Venue: Appears in a peer-reviewed journal, academic press, or official conference — not just a blog or news site.

Methodology & Evidence: Explains how data was collected/analyzed and presents empirical evidence (data, graphs, tables).


Credible Academic Source


4) 	References & Citations: Connects to prior research 
through citations and a bibliography.

5) Objectivity & Currency: Written in formal, neutral 
language, acknowledges limitations, and is recent 
enough to be relevant.


The Activity Objective: 

Hypothetical Student Objectives (3): 

Objective 1 — Measure energy production

Question: Does the article give estimates of renewable energy potential from floating solar panels or “Floating PhotoVoltaic Panels (FPVs)?

The Activity Objective: 

Hypothetical Student Objectives: 

Objective 2 — Identify environmental or technical co-benefits

Question: Does the article describe efficiency improvements, evaporation reduction, or hydropower synergies?

The Activity Objective: 

Hypothetical Student Objectives: 

Objective 3 — Compare cost-effectiveness vs. fossil fuels

Question: Does the article show whether FPV is cheaper or more expensive than fossil fuel energy?

The Activity Objective: 

Engineer your “Prompt Template” for this activity: 

Identity: 

Role: 

Task: 
Research Objective 
“from the article below”

The Activity Objective: 

The overall process…

Feed the article a chunk at a time into an LM Studio Chat along with your prompt template. 

Each Prompt will have 2 pieces:

A note on how LM Studio Works: 

Each “conversation” is a folder. 
You can create these

Each “chat” is a file in a folder. 
You can create these

You can organize all of the above.

TODAY’S TASK

Engineer a prompt template. What you know about the scenario: 
A student has specific research objectives.
A student has an article on Floating Photovoltaic Panels. 
A student wants to know if the article can help them with their research objectives.

What is the prompt template looking like?
