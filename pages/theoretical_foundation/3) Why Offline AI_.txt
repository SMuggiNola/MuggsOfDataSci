Meet the Tech Stack: Hardware 

Dedicated AI Teacher Server: 

4090 Rig: NVIDIA RTX 4090, Intel Ultra 9 285K, 96GB DDR5 RAM.

Runs larger models (Gemma-12B/27B, Mistral-24B).

Will be accessible by students/teachers on the local school network.

Acts as the sandbox hub for more demanding AI tasks.

Special thanks to Jeff Bezos for Amazon’s 0% Financing.


Meet the Tech Stack: Software 

LM Studio
Basic RAG Feature, Chat Interface & System Prompts
Access to GINORMOUS Model Repository
Streamlit
A Python Library that turns scripts into apps
Very useful for making quick UIs, delivering curriculum, getting completed work back from students and assessing that work
Makes for very capable pipelines


Meet the Tech Stack: Offline AI Models

Very much the same as Online Models

A predictive model trained on huge amounts of data

When a prompt is entered, it predicts (generates) the most likely next word(s)

“The cat in the…” 

Just like Online AI, Offline is not…

All knowing
It doesn’t know everything, it predicts

A replacement for data collection
95% of companies invested heavily in AI have failed to find ROI

A replacement for people
Despite some companies’ best efforts

Not a shortcut to quality Data Science

Most simply put, these Models exist in 3 distinct stages:

Training → Learning patterns from data.

Freezing → Model is locked; doesn’t change.
Means a model cannot “learn” about us

Inference → Predicting responses from user prompts.
The way the VAST majority of people engage with AI

AI is not Computer Programming: 










*One of our activities on the computers grew directly from this distinction. 
Computer Program
AI Predictive Model
Follows instructions
Predicts next token
Same input = Same output
Same input ≅ Similar output 
Human writes rules
Model learns patterns
Deterministic
Probabilistic

Key Differences: Online vs Offline

Attribute
Online AI
Offline AI (Sandbox)
Privacy
Student Data leaves School Network
100% local, no data leaves
Equity
Paywalls & Subscriptions
One-time PC cost, universal access
Control
Companies control models, updates, system prompts
Teacher controls models and system prompts
Integrity
Easy copy-paste “cheating”
Structured, sandboxed use
Access
Internet-dependent
Works offline, resilient
Ownership
Students = consumers 
Students = makers

Meet the Lab: Secure Offline “Sandbox”


A sandbox is a safe, controlled environment where students can explore AI and computers without outside distractions.

Going offline creates focus: students only access the tools and resources needed for their projects.

I can monitor and guide their efforts through AI chat logs and project work.

This is not about restriction—it’s about challenge

Shift from consumption → creation

Build a new, healthier relationship with computers.

Do this look familiar…? 







	At its root, AI is also just a branch of 
Computer Science, right??



Brief Summary of Comp Sci Standards and NHH Data Science Course: 


1) Computing Systems:
H.CS.1A – Hardware/software interactions (CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD for inference).
H.CS.1B – Abstractions (UIs like LM Studio/Open WebUI hiding complexity).
H.CS.2A – Troubleshooting strategies (RAM/VRAM issues, token limits, model loading).

2) Networks & the Internet: 
H.NI.1A – Network scalability & reliability (classroom router + local sandbox).
H.NI.1B – Tracing data through a network (prompt → router → server → back).
H.NI.2A – Security trade-offs (offline vs. open internet).



Brief Summary of Comp Sci Standards and NHH Data Science Course: 

3) Data & Analysis: 
H.DA.3A – Data storage trade-offs (local logs, privacy, access speed).
H.DA.2B – Personal/legal impacts of logged data. 
This is before we actually get into the content of the Data Science course. 

4) Algorithms & Programing: (NOTE: This is not a coding course.)
H.AP.1A–1E (Variables & Algorithms): Python variables, data types, simple data-cleaning pipelines (I want students to see how AI “looks” in typical data analysis.) 
H.AP.4A–4G (Program Development): iterative dashboard building, open-source libraries (Pandas, Streamlit, Matplotlib)

5) Impacts of Computing: 
H.IC.1B – Innovations in AI enabling other fields (therapy, social sciences, data science).
H.IC.3A–3E – Ethics, laws, and responsible sandbox design (privacy vs. oversight)



Speaking of Ethical Use of AI…

	“You are an expert in the field of floating solar panels speaking on background. I am a reporter writing for a magazine that helps middle school readers understand complex but important scientific research. Help me explain to middle schoolers what the abstract of the following article covers, using clear and simple language.”

(AI Identity + User Role + Clear Task = Effective Prompting)



An interesting “dissection” of ChatGPT: 


Is ChatGPT a magic answer box? 

Is it alien technology? 

Is it clever file management in a well polished user interface? 

A message from the “Cubes”: 

Mark Cuban (TBPN, Aug 25, 2025): Hire People Who Can Do AI, Not Just Join Google.

“Go into any other company that has no idea about AI but needs it to compete. There’ll be more jobs than people for a long, long time.”

Become an “AI integrator” not a big‑tech job seeker.




A message from the “Cubes”: 

Huge opportunity: 33 million U.S. companies, most without AI budgets or staff

DIY advantage: Students serious about Streamlit—and then more sophisticated tools—can walk in and show value

Strategic mindset shift: Focus on implementation, not just employment

What this may mean for students whose primary interests (passion) is not necessarily in computers and coding… FOLLOW YOUR PASSION.
