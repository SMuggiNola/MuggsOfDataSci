  "stage": "Stage 1 — Ask Questions",
  "objective": "To explore curiosity as the foundation of research by learning to ask progressively deeper questions about visible, hidden, and systemic aspects of a phenomenon.",
  "instructions": {
    "overview": "Questions perpetuate investigation and discovery. Answers imply completion. This reflective activity invites you to delay answers as long as possible and build your capacity for inquiry.",
    "mechanics": "Write in full sentences with proper punctuation and capitalization. Each question should feel complete and precise. Let your writing flow—avoid lists or fragments.",
    "reminder": "If the door to discovery is a question, an answer is the lock. Leave the door unlocked."
